This Application describes about the Restful Api where I used modern Libraries like Retrofit, Eventbus
and Butterknife. Retrofit is used to refactor the code by making another classes and its depedencies.
Eventbus is used to cast the corresponding view in the layout. In this app, I have used to get the current 
weather fom the cloud. Here we used DarkSky.net from which we can pull the current weather data. The data is
in the form of GSON formate.
